# cis-definitions

**Enterprise Assets** - Devices and computing belonging to the enterprise and which are commonly on the network.  It includes End User Compute, Servers, Network Equipment, IoT Devices (cameras, sensors), Smart Operational Equipment (Refrigerators, Automated Guided Vehicles).  In the context of CIS 1 Enterprise Assets are these devices.  In the context of CIS 2 this includes software and applications that process data.  In the context of CIS 4 this includes both the devices and the software since they all need to be configured to a secure standard.

**Sensitive Systems** - Used a a mechanism for discriminating between sensitive and non sensitive systems.  Sensitive systems would process information that is classed as highly confidential, need to be protected to meet a regulatory need or which underpin the organisations critical processes.  If the definition is extended to confidential then it no longer provides a discrimination in most organisations.

**Sensitive Data** is physical or digital data stored, processed, or managed by the enterprise that must be kept private, accurate, reliable, and available. If released or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, it would cause harm to the enterprise or its customers. These impacts may be due to a data breach or a violation of a policy, contract, or regulation. 

**Asset** - In the context of CIS, asset is mostly recognised as a configuration item.  Not asset in the financial value and depreciation sense.

**End User Devices** - A subset of Enterprise Assets and which does not include company issued mobile phones.  Compute devices such as laptops, tablets, desktops, virtual desktops.  Does not include similar operating systems used for a different purpose such as conference tablets, digital signage.

**Mobile End User Devices** - The company owned mobile devices not covered previously in End User Devices or Enterprise Assets

**Privileged Account** - An account that has one or more administrative rights (not necessarily an administrator) such as the ability to create, update or delete users, groups, edit logs, assign privileges, install and/or configure software. modify system settings.

**Enterprise** - An organisation with a defined mission/goal and a defined boundary, using information systems to execute that mission, and with responsibility for managing its own risks and performance. An enterprise may consist of all or some of the following business aspects: acquisition, program management, financial management (e.g., budgets), human resources, security, and information systems, information and mission management. NIST

**Network Architecture** - Refers to how a network is designed, both physically and logically. It defines how a network is organised, including the connections between devices and software as well as the data that is transmitted between them. This should include network architecture diagrams and security architecture diagrams. CIS

**Network Infrastructure** - Refers to all of the resources of a network that make network or internet connectivity, management, business operations, and communication possible. It consists of hardware and software, systems and devices, and it enables computing and communication between users, services, applications, and processes. Network infrastructure can be in the cloud, physical, or virtual.

**Revised Sensitive Data** - The CIS definition above could cause some organisations to exhaust budget protecting high volume internal and confidential data.  If public data or that which must not be kept private is a small subset of the overall data landscape, sensitive becomes **ALL**.  It might be necessary to discriminate between information that needs special protection and/or detection controls.  Highly confidential information, Sensitive Personal Information, Reporting and Accounts before publication, Mergers and Acquisition information, board papers, credentials & secrets, log information, designs or other material that discloses the security controls in effect at the enterprise.
